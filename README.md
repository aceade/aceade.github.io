# aceade.github.io
Repository for my github.io landing page/portfolio. Keeping this with pure HTML/CSS because I don't see any reason to use JavaScript for this sort of thing.

## Accessibility

I've run this through the WAVE addon from [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/). That has not reported any issues, but let me know if there are any.

## Third-party assets
- [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com) - icons for social media and other links
